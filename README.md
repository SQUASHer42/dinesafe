# DineSafeTO

DineSafeTO is an android app that allows users to query for food inspection data from http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=b54a5f9cd70bb210VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD. The purpose of this project was to make the data inside the dinesafe.xml provided by DineSafe Toronto more accessible to consumers.
